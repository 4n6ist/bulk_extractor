For Programmer's manual:
Is bulk_extractor PM and BEViewer PM one document or two?

I should write the BEViewer PM.

I see the bulk_extractor PM as having two sections:

1) bulk_extractor API so people can know how to integrate a new scanner into the framework.
2) a design document detailing how all the parts work, specifically a) the API infrastructure, and b) details of each individual scanner.

current questions:
Who is the target for this document?  How much of (2) do we need? Should we have one document with the two separate sections?
