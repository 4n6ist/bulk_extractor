July 12, 2012 (bda):
The existing user's manual is old, and consists of old BEViewer content
and bulk_extractor usage.

The new user's manual, for the first pass, will consist of bulk_extractor content
and a link to the existing BEViewer summary in trunk/java_gui/summary_usage.

This is the current draft outline of the new user's manual (it needs to be built up):



For User's Manual:
We have an old UM that I started for BEViewer at trunk/doc/user_manual.

For BEViewer UM, I need to know how thorough of a user's manual that we want.  We currently have a brief get-it-done summary at trunk/doc/summary_usage that I put on github for our bulk_extractor-users folks.  I targeted it for people who want the facts fast without having to read a manual, which is what I would want.  Although nobody has said anything about it, it has had 100 downloads.  I could just spruce it up a bit and have it be our BEViewer UM.

For bulk_extractor UM: I don't know what it would include.  The old UM at trunk/doc/user_manual has a chapter "Running bulk_extractor from the command line" that we can start with.  The new bulk_extractor UM work should replace what is there now.  I think I would start with this outline:
- intro and ref to Simson's bulk_extractor technical paper.
- Command-line options
-- scanning
-- reading
-- recovery
- Topics (extrapolate from bulk_extractor github wiki

Is bulk_extractor UM and BEViewer UM one document or two?
