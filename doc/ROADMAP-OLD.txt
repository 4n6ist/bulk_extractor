Bulk Extractor 1.3.   Feature Freeze: 15 JUN.  Beta: 1 JUL. Release: 1 AUG
==========================================================================

New in v1.3:

+ consider local context for ethernet reporting.
+ Rewrite scan_exif to use our own exif parser
+ Scan for the start of bitlocker protected volumes.
+ Feature files indicate source file, BOM, feature file name, and other information
+ Encrypted data detection
+ FATFS Directory Carving and Parsing.
+ NTFS MFT Carving and Parsing.
+ Mutex class - simplify locking & improved reliability
+ VCARD carving - VCARDs are found and deposited into a directory
+ base16 scanning - detects MD5 & SHA1 hasshes.
+ PE-header detection and decoding
+ ELF header detection and decoding
+ Reports if it is CPU-bound or I/O-bound after each run
+ Report in XML file which threads we are waiting for, what page was being analyzed,
  and the current scanner...
+ Regular expressions are now regular expressions in all cases, and never globs. (No more *@company.com; you must say .*@company.com)
+ environment variable BULK_EXTRACTOR_DEBUG is now the default value for debug; debug=1 does more sanity checks
  and only prints if there is an error.
+ Each thread records how long it spends waiting. The program reports if it is CPU-bound or IO-bound.
+ Each thread should records how long it spends waiting.
=======

Bug fixes:
+ scan_base64 crashed with -j1 -Y 28382855168 /corp/nps/drives/nps-2011-2tb/nps-2011-2tb.E01
  (error in base64_pton_forensic)
+ removed all uses of alloca, per http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1018853/why-is-alloca-not-considered-good-practice
+ image_process_fts.cpp - remove and replace with dig.cpp
  + dig.cpp needs to be tested on Windows with mingw cross-compiling

For 1.3:

- -Y 0-32m doesn't run on 
+ make sure all of the scanners in the plugins directory compile.
